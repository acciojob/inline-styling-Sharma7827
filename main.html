        <p>Flowers, the reproductive structures of flowering plants (angiosperms), play a vital role in plant reproduction. Their main components include petals, sepals, stamens (male parts), and pistils (female parts). Flowers attract pollinators with their color, scent, and nectar, facilitating pollination and fertilization, which lead to seed formation. They are essential for ecosystems, providing food for pollinators, and hold significant economic value in horticulture and agriculture. Flowers like roses, tulips, daisies, orchids, and sunflowers are widely recognized and appreciated. Beyond their ecological and economic importance, flowers hold cultural significance and are symbols in various human traditions and emotions. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect endangered species and maintain biodiversity, as flowers face threats from habitat loss, climate change, and pollution.</p>
